In marine sediments, methane may be present either in permafrost or in gas hydrates. Warming of the Arctic may lead to the release of stored methane, leading to further warming and then to further methane releases in a reinforcing cycle. The East Siberian Sea, in the Arctic Ocean, is a large area with a great deal of undersea permafrost and, likely, stored methane. Recent work has suggested large sources of methane from parts of the East Siberian Sea, but the area needs to be mapped and studied in much greater detail before either the amount of methane stored there or the amount being released can be fully understood. In the summer of 2014, an international program called the Swedish-Russian-US Arctic Ocean Investigation of Climate-Cryosphere-Carbon Interactions (SWERUS-C3) will undertake a 90-day expedition to map, and study the carbon cycle in, the East Siberian Sea. The principal investigators of this proposal are leaders in ocean mapping and they have recently pioneered techniques for acoustic imaging of methane plumes released from the seafloor in the Gulf of Mexico. They have been invited by the leaders of the SWERUS-C3 team to participate in one leg of the expedition. They propose to use the multibeam sonar on board the ODEN to locate and characterize gas seeps in the water column and then apply a newly developed wideband transceiver to the split-beam echosounder on board the ODEN to constrain the size and fate of gas bubbles rising to the surface. Together, these acoustic observations will help the SWERUS-C3 team understand the flux of methane from the seafloor into the water column and potentially into the atmosphere. If successful, these techniques will allow the mapping of the gas flux in the Arctic over scales never before possible. This proposal requests support for the participation of the UNH team on this expedition and for post-cruise work-up of the data. The project will support a full time graduate student at UNH. A UNH undergraduate student will participate as well. The SWERUS-C3 program as a whole will support over 15 postdoctoral researchers and graduate students, and has a broad suite of outreach activities planned. The UNH Center for Coastal Ocean Mapping will also incorporate this work into ongoing outreach and education activities."

Accurate records of natural variability that cover broad temporal and spatial scales, and that capture intervals of non-linear change are needed to fully comprehend the arctic system. This project aims to develop the first system model to simulate the full chain of processes that control how weather and climate affect the processes that lead to deposition of a sediment record in lakes in glaciated watersheds. This model provides an alternative approach to previous statistically-based models traditionally used by paleo-climatologists to infer past climate variability from lake sediment records. The new process-based quantitative understanding will lay the groundwork for future studies that will be aimed at recovering records of environmental and climate change that extend back thousands of years. 

This project will contribute to ongoing efforts through collaborations with: utility managers of the Municipality of Anchorage who are planning for diminished glacier meltwater input to Eklutna Lake, a major source of their electricity and freshwater and with resource managers at US Fish and Wildlife Service who are developing a monitoring network for the Arctic Refuge and who are striving to foresee future changes in habitat quality associated with glacier retreat. This project will benefit climate science researchers by leading to more accurate climate reconstructions, which will be used as benchmarks for validating global climate model output. Finally, it will support four early-career scientists and will train graduate and undergraduate students in system-science research.

Technical

The primary goal of this project is to develop a system model that encodes the major processes that govern the amount and grain size of sediment that accumulates in arctic lakes in glaciated catchments, and to acquire the field-based data for model input and testing. Sediments that accumulate at the bottom of arctic lakes contain a wealth of information about how major features of the surrounding watershed have varied on seasonal to millennial time scales, as well as how they have responded to natural and anthropogenic forcings. Lakes in glaciated watersheds record changes in the melt rate of upstream glaciers, which are among the most dynamic components of the evolving arctic system. The sediment stored in glacier-fed lakes often comprise distinct rhythmic layers that represent annual cycles. These varved sediments are among the most valuable of all natural archives on Earth because they can be placed on a precise time line, and because they accumulate at a rate that is sufficiently high to track environmental variability on annual, and often seasonal, scales. They have been used extensively to reconstruct past climate changes in the Arctic, most often relying on statistical correlations between records from long-term weather stations and varve thickness. These statistical correlations disregard the complex and time-evolving interactions within the glacier-hydrology-lake-sedimentation system that link climate to changing properties of sediment deposited at the lake bottom. A more process-based understanding of the interactions that control sedimentation within lakes of glaciated catchments is needed to provide the next generation of paleoclimate reconstructions. By incorporating a system-modeling approach, a process-based system model will be developed to capture dynamic nonlinearities in the glacier-hydrology-lake-sedimentation system. The system model will couple three existing model components: a physically based, spatially explicit hydrological model, which includes a glacier sub-model; an empirically based sediment-flux model; and a process-response, basin-filling sedimentation model. The system model will be applied to three glaciated watersheds that fall along an environmental gradient spanning from the sub-Arctic to the High Arctic, including Lake Linne (Svalbard), Lake Peters (near McCall Glacier, Arctic National Wildlife Refuge), and Eklutna Lake (near Anchorage, Alaska). This study builds on extensive previous and on-going process studies at or near each of the study sites. Existing data and proposed glacier, hydrology, limnology, and sediment process studies will provide the input data to run the system model and to validate its output."

Glacier surges can have an immediate and detrimental impact on ecosystems situated in their path.  Few such surges have been carefully observed and described making it difficult to understand what characteristics of surging glaciers can be expected as typical and what range of variability is realistic to anticipate.

"doi:10.18739/A28G8FH70",1107892,"Permafrost thaw exposes previously frozen soil organic matter to microbial decomposition. This process generates methane and carbon dioxide, and thereby fuels a positive feedback process that leads to further warming and thaw. Despite widespread permafrost degradation during the past ~40 years, the degree to which permafrost thaw may be contributing to a feedback between warming and thaw in recent decades is not well understood. Radiocarbon evidence of modern emissions of ancient permafrost carbon is also sparse. Here we combine radiocarbon dating of lake bubble trace-gas methane (113 measurements) and soil organic carbon (289 measurements) for lakes in Alaska, Canada, Sweden and Siberia with numerical modelling of thaw and remote sensing of  thermokarst shore expansion. Methane emissions from thermokarst areas of lakes that have expanded over the past 60 years were directly proportional to the mass of soil carbon inputs to the lakes from the erosion of thawing permafrost. Radiocarbon dating indicates that methane age
from lakes is nearly identical to the age of permafrost soil carbon thawing around them. Based on this evidence of landscape-scale permafrost carbon feedback, we estimate that 0.2 to 2.5 Pg permafrost carbon was released as methane and carbon dioxide in thermokarst expansion zones of pan-Arctic lakes during the past 60 years.","Tan, Z., Zhuang, Q.

at Flagship Observatories in Alaska and Siberia

ABSTRACT

The arctic landscape interacts with the global and regional climate by exchanging carbon dioxide, methane, water, and energy with the atmosphere.  Understanding how these exchanges are regulated and how they change is a key goal of the US Study of Environmental Arctic Change and the NSF Arctic Observatory Network.  The first goal of this work is year round monitoring of carbon, water, and energy balance at two arctic sites, Imnavait Creek in Alaska and Cherskii in Siberia.  The work will be a collaboration among researchers from the Marine Biological Laboratory, the University of Alaska Fairbanks, Northeast Science Station, Russia, and the University of Michigan.  The second goal is the development of these two sites as  ?Flagship? observatories for research on arctic lands and freshwaters.  The main task here is to integrate the new carbon, water, and energy balance data with the already large, diverse, and growing data bases from other research done at these sites.  A third aim is to promote PanArctic comparisons and development of PanArctic data bases.
  
	Broader impacts include contributions to education, including underrepresented groups, through participation in the Logan Science Journalism program, the Arctic Long-Term Ecological Research Schoolyard program, and outreach to Native Alaskan communities.  Research and education infrastructure will be enhanced by making the data bases available online.  Benefits to society include improved understanding of the impacts of climate change, especially in Alaska where the local residents are closely tied to the land through traditional, subsistence lifestyles."

These images are primarily vertical stereo black and white images, although single oblique images, as well as color images have been collected. The glaciers of North America were the subjects, and the digital products made available here serve to document the changes that have occurred to the glaciers over the past 5 decades. The purpose of this project is to preserve the data contained within these film images in a digital format for future analysis of North American glacier change.   File Layout:    1.   The first level contains an overall data set of image metadata from 1964 - 1997 (nagapData.csv) and an R script (searchData.R) with instructions on how to search and subset the data.  fileLayout.pdf shows the file structure and folder contents visually.  There are also three kml files with flight path information by decade.   2.   The second level is the year in which the pictures were taken.  There are 32 years with images from 1964 – 1997.  The majority of these folders are jpegs with notes provided by Austin Post.  They also contain a year-specific csv (YYYY.csv) that contains image metadata for the entire year (date, roll numbers, location name, longitude, latitude, altitude, media, and comments).  The overall data set (nagapData.csv) is the aggregate of each individual “YYYY.csv” file.   3.   The glacier photos are located at the third level (this level).  The folders at this level are distinguished by camera roll number (1, 2, etc.), and image type (thumbnail, jpeg, or tif); some also contain fiducial and oblique image folders.

To do this a critical first step will involve understanding the conditions under which surface aerosol conditions, as generally used in the compilation of statistical datasets addressing this issue, are comparable to those at cloud level. Using a variety of techniques, the distinction between surface-coupled and decoupled cloud states will focus evaluation of aerosol-cloud interactions on appropriate cases, reducing statistical contamination. From these cases, a statistical evaluation will be performed to reveal co-variation between key cloud (e.g. liquid water path, ice water path) and aerosol (e.g. concentration, size, hygroscopicity) properties. Combined with surface radiation measurements and idealized radiative transfer simulations, the results from this evaluation will provide an improved estimate of the net radiative impact of aerosols on Arctic clouds. Additionally, it will provide an overview of the seasonal evolution and surface-state dependence of these relationships.  Outreach plans include several visits to Arctic regions, with a focus on the North Slope of Alaska and Greenland. The primary aim of these visits is to disseminate information relevant to the proposed research to seminar audiences consisting of local people (including underrepresented native people), primary school students, and local officials. A secondary aim of these visits is to give Arctic researchers (particularly early career researchers) who have never had a chance to visit the Arctic themselves an opportunity to see firsthand the region on which their efforts focus.

The combination of these data sets will provide urgently required, base-line information on how species presence varies seasonally with changes in sea ice, currents, ocean water temperatures and freshwater flow. Building on opportunistic proof-of-concept deployments in the strait in the last 2 years, the proposed effort will also provide critical, consistent data on interannual variability, and allow for the testing of cutting edge scientific hypotheses such as: how do oceanographic conditions dictate the residency of different marine mammal species? Are temperate species ?invading? the Arctic? What is the correlation between ice cover and marine mammal sound production?

The Bering Strait is the only oceanic connection between the Pacific and the Arctic oceans. It is through this narrow (~85 km) passageway that the entire population of Bering-Chukchi-Beaufort bowhead whales passes twice yearly and that herds of beluga whales access Arctic waters. It is thought to be year-round habitat for ice seals and walrus . The Bering Strait is also the path by which Pacific sub-Arctic marine species are invading the Arctic. As the Northwest Passage becomes a viable Pacific-Atlantic shipping route, every ship along this route will pass through Bering Strait. It is, therefore, the region where climate change and changing anthropogenic utilization may have sizeable impacts on local marine fauna, and where changing fluxes of marine mammals to the Arctic can be well observed. Passive acoustic monitoring is the only method currently available to identify year-round, and in all weather conditions, the presence of marine mammals and other physical (ice movement) or anthropogenic (ships, oil and gas seismic exploration) sounds."

Since 2007, the ITEX-Arctic Observatory Network (ITEX-AON) has continued and expanded on the ITEX program across a latitudinal transect of five sites in Alaska and Greenland, collecting core ITEX data specifically designed to address the current needs outlined in the Study of Environmental Arctic Change (SEARCH) Implementation Report.  The goal of this effort is to maintain the continuity of the temporally-critical datasets of the ITEX-AON in Alaska and Greenland.  Core datasets include the long-term manual observations of phenology, vegetation structure and composition, ecosystem function, and surface properties on the long-term ITEX control and experimental warming plots, repeat measurement of the vegetation plots on the 1km2 ARCSS grids, and a multifactor warming-moisture experiment in Greenland.  The simultaneous measurement of multiple surface properties at the small scale has allowed detection of relationships not previously recognized, e.g., in moss-dominated areas of the intensive transects, higher albedo is linked to higher temperatures.  Continuation of these measurements is imperative because increasing evidence points towards the critical importance of carry-over effects of the previous growing seasons on current and future responses and the inherent variability in the system precluded determination of the system response on the basis of a few years.

Global change models predict boreal forests will become increasingly susceptible to fire activity with climate warming. Because these forests contain a large proportion of global terrestrial carbon (C) stocks, changes in the fire regime are likely to alter global C cycling. Increased fire activity will increase C emissions to the atmosphere, with a potential positive feedback to climate warming. However, an altered fire regime may also initiate cascading effects on forest regrowth and permafrost degradation that could magnify or offset this feedback. Fire effects on these ecological mechanisms remain uncertain but will ultimately determine whether arctic ecosystems act as a C source or sink under future climate change scenarios. The primary objective of this research is to increase our understanding of post-fire C dynamics in boreal forests of the Siberian arctic by elucidating the ecological mechanisms by which increased fire severity could influence C accumulation and storage over the successional interval. The overarching hypothesis is that post-fire soil organic layer (SOL) depth regulates net ecosystem carbon balance (NECB) through indirect impacts on forest regrowth and permafrost stability because of its role as a barrier to seed germination and thermal regulator. The team will: 1) link near term fire effects on SOL depth to changes in larch recruitment and permafrost characteristics in experimental burn plots created in 2012, 2) determine the relationship between post-fire stand structure and above- and belowground C pools at the local and landscape level across stands of varying age and topographic positions, and 3) test via experimental manipulations and field observations the mechanisms by which fire-driven changes in stand density indirectly affect moss growth, SOL development, and susceptibility of deeper C pools to warming, decomposition, and release into the atmosphere. This research will offer novel insights into the importance of both vegetation and soil processes within arctic ecosystems in determining the net feedback of an intensified fire regime to the climate system.

Intellectual Merit: Larch forests of the Siberian arctic comprise 20% of all boreal forest ecosystems and are distinct from other boreal forests in that they consist of a single tree genus (Larix spp.) with a deciduous growth habit and often grow on continuous, C-rich ?yedoma? permafrost. Thus, their response to warming climate and an altered fire regime is likely to differ from boreal forests in other regions. Uncertainties regarding current C pools in Siberian boreal forests remain a significant factor affecting our ability to predict climate-induced changes to the global C cycle. The proposed study will contribute to our understanding of how arctic forest fires impact global C cycling and provide essential data necessary for scaling-up arctic C pools, estimating C emissions from arctic fires, and calibrating predictive models of future global C cycling.

Broader Impacts: This project will result in the training of undergraduate and graduate students from two predominantly undergraduate institutions and one Hispanic-Serving Institution. The PI and her students will develop outreach activities with local K-12 schools in south Texas to help teachers create lesson plans involving arctic science, boreal ecology, and climate change and involve researcher presentations to science classrooms to provide real-life examples of arctic research and expose K-12 students to different career and educational paths in the sciences."

In order to improve predictions that enable us to anticipate and plan for future change in ice cover on seasonal to decadal time scales, we need to understand the processes driving the observed change. An area of particular interest is the temperature-driven mass balance of the ice cover. The mass balance is the balance between the amount of ice growth in the winter and the amount of melt in the summer. Mass balance is a key climate change indicator since it combines the impact of heating and cooling at the top and bottom of the ice. If there is net warming over time, then there will be thinning of the ice. Conversely, net cooling leads to thicker ice. The objective of our project is to contribute to the Arctic Observing Network by maintaining a network of autonomous ice mass balance (IMB) buoys, installed in the drift ice of the Arctic Ocean. The observations from these buoys enable us to explore what changes in sea ice thickness are taking place and how these changes occur, thereby improving our understanding of this complex and important component of the global environment. Broader Impacts include contributing to Dartmouth College?s Women in Science Program and an ?adopt a buoy? program for middle school students. 

The primary objectives of our project are to: 1) procure and deploy a minimum of 5 IMB buoys per year, to  increase network coverage, and 2) process and archive the data from these buoys to ensure that they are fully, freely, openly, and immediately accessible to all researchers and interested users. A key to achieving the first objective is an advancement in buoy technology, creating a version of the IMB that costs less to produce, is easier to deploy, and is designed for deployment in the increasingly prevalent seasonal sea ice cover. We will continue to strategically deploy the IMBs in coordination with complementary atmospheric and oceanographic instruments to optimize the observations throughout the Arctic Ocean. We will also continue to build on our strong national and international collaborations, to maximize the extent of the IMB network across the Arctic Basin and to minimize the logistic costs associated with deployment. The end result will be an integrated atmosphere-ice-ocean observing array providing a comprehensive description of the response of the ice cover to atmospheric and oceanic forcing."

While the basic tenets that underlie interpretation of isotopic information appear robust in a mean sense, meteorological and glaciological processes can confound simple interpretations. Processes of concern are variations in moisture sources, cloud processes, surface ablation, blowing snow and vapor diffusion in the firn. The project objectives are to resolve fundamental uncertainties in the controls on the isotopic composition of the ice sheet through a 3-year measurement campaign at Summit, Eureka and Reykjavik. The project will use measurements and modeling to evaluate 1) the degree to which oxygen isotopic composition and deuterium excess of snow capture variations in moisture sources versus cloud microphysical conditions, and 2) the degree to which blowing snow and vapor diffusion within the firn confound accurate interpretation of variability in the isotopic record. Continuous measurements of the isotopic composition of water vapor and daily measurements of the isotopic composition of freshly-fallen and blowing snow will be made at Summit, Eureka and Reykjavik. These will be combined with measurements of the amount, size distribution, and approximate habit of falling and blowing snow, turbulence measurements to evaluate snow lofting, surface latent heat flux (ablation and frost) and energy balance, and remote sensing of polar clouds and atmospheric structure. High-resolution firn cores will be drilled to reconcile the detailed isotopic measurements and modeling with glaciological records. The new isotope measurements will jump start an emerging international pan-Arctic cooperative network of isotope measurements, which complements Arctic observations under existing Arctic Observing Network activities.

Notwithstanding its importance, our understanding of submarine melting is limited and it is presently absent or crudely parameterized in glacier, ice sheet and climate models. Greenland's tidewater glaciers end in about 600 to 800 m deep, long fjords that connect the margins of the ice sheet to the shelf. The glaciers termini are typically grounded several hundreds of meters below sea-level and, as such, are exposed to a thick portion of the fjord's water column. Unique data, recently collected by two of the investigators, from two large glacial fjords in south-east Greenland show that these are filled year-round with cold, fresh waters of Arctic origin and warm, salty waters of subtropical origin whose different properties influence the circulation at the ice-edge. Furthermore, ship-based and moored velocity measurements show that the fjords are characterized by fast, highly variable, sheared flows and a vigorous fjord/shelf exchange which, likely, play a role in transporting heat to the glaciers termini. The implication is that submarine melt rates depend on a suite of oceanic processes including externally forced fjord circulations, fjord/shelf exchange and the distribution of properties on the shelf. Yet, the details of how these processes may contribute to the submarine melt rate or affect its variability are presently unknown.

This project will fill this gap by combining the analysis of ship-based and moored data from the two fjords with a hierarchy of models (laboratory and numerical) to identify the parameters and mechanisms which control the properties and circulation in the fjords and the rate of submarine melting at the ocean/glacier interface. Having identified the controls on the submarine melt rate, the project investigators will then use historical oceanographic and atmospheric data to determine fjord conditions and submarine melt rates for the period preceding the acceleration of the glaciers when no fjord data are available. Climate model predictions will be used to estimate the potential impact of future oceanic variability on submarine melting of Greenland?s glaciers. Collaborations with experts in outlet glacier dynamics, the physics of the ice-ocean boundary and fjord circulations will provide expertise in related disciplines and a two-way exchange of information for this intrinsically multidisciplinary problem. The work proposed is aimed at understanding a newly discovered wiring of the climate system: that ocean variability can have a rapid and direct impact on the Greenland's ice sheet mass balance. It is timely because of the large and unpredicted changes that are occurring in Greenland and relevant because ice sheet/ocean interactions are presently absent from climate and ice sheet/glacier models. It is complementary to the study of ice sheet/ocean interactions around Antarctica (the more studied of the two) since both the large-scale ocean circulation and the presence of narrow, long fjords in Greenland contribute a unique set of relevant dynamical mechanisms.

Broader Impacts: This work seeks to increase our understanding of a previously overlooked, important connection in our climate system which has profound implications for our ability to accurately predict sea-level rise - an issue of grave and immediate societal concern. It is expected that results from this work will contribute to the inclusion of the relevant dynamics (even if in parameterized form) in future models and, as such, lead to the improvement of future sea level predictions. The work plan involves several international experts from complementary fields and, as such, will contribute to fostering interactions between the multiple disciplines involved and beyond national boundaries. It involves two graduate students and one post-doc who will be exposed to a cutting-edge problem and multidisciplinary team of researchers. Results from this project will be widely disseminated to scientists across disciplines, as demonstrated by the PIs long-track of organizing summer schools and working groups, and to the public through different media outlets, as shown by the recent coverage of the investigators' Greenland work in venues that include the Museum of Science in Boston, the New York Times, the Weather Channel and Italian National Television."

"doi:10.18739/A2VX0633H",1702456,"The Pacific sector of the Arctic Ocean is experiencing major reductions in seasonal sea ice extent and increases in sea surface temperatures. One of the key uncertainties in this region is how the marine ecosystem will respond to seasonal shifts in the timing of spring sea ice retreat and/or delays in fall sea ice formation. Variations in upper ocean water hydrography, planktonic production, pelagic-benthic coupling and sediment carbon cycling are all influenced by sea ice and temperature change. To more systematically track the broad biological response to sea ice retreat and associated environmental change, an international consortium of scientists have developed a coordinated Distributed Biological Observatory (DBO) that includes selected biological measurements at multiple trophic levels, along with satellite and mooring measurements. The DBO currently focuses on five regional biological hotspot locations along a latitudinal gradient that allows for consistent sampling and monitoring at five biologically productive locations across a latitudinal gradient: DBO 1 (SLIP)-south of St. Lawrence Island (SLI), DBO2 (Chirikov)-north of SLI, DBO3 (southern Chukchi Sea), DBO4-NE Chukchi Sea, and DBO5-Barrow Canyon.

The Distributed Biological Observatory studies these changes in the northern Bering and Chukchi seas. Investigators sample locations that are biologically important in U.S. territorial waters. These locations have been sampled annually since 2010.  Other investigators also sample the same locations. As a result, the locations are sampled multiple times a year. Data are collected on environmental conditions including water column and sea floor animals that are food for whales, seals, and birds. Data are shared internationally. The project contributes to the U.S. National Ocean Policy and Interagency Arctic Research Policy Committee 5-year plan.  The data will be of value to U.S. and international science and management agencies, private industry, and local communities as they try to understand changes to the environment. The project supports three graduate students.

The observational plan includes standard hydrographic and biological measurements along five transect lines located in the northern Bering and Chukchi Seas. These sampling locations are arrayed south-to-north and reflect a gradient of seasonal sea ice change and seawater warming. The investigators chose these 5 regions because they are zones of high biological productivity and biodiversity. Results so far indicate a freshening and warming of Pacific seawater which transits northward over the spring to fall season. These changes have impacted prey for larger marine mammals and seabirds. Satellite observations are also used to evaluate seasonal changes in sea ice concentration, surface seawater temperature, and chlorophyll concentration. The biological measurements focus on lower trophic levels and shipboard surveys of upper trophic level organisms. This research will increase our understanding of the impact of key environmental forcing parameters on biological change in the system. The collection of key prey-predator biological data along with physical and chemical measurements will allow for analyses and ecosystem modeling which will promote better understanding of Arctic environmental changes."

Massive ice in the form of ice wedges occupies 10?70% of near- surface permafrost and fundamentally influences the dynamics and vulnerability of arctic ecosystems to climate change. Arctic permafrost has been considered stable because ground temperatures remain low, but recent observations in northern Alaska of an abrupt increase in degradation of ice-wedges, indicate that even permafrost in the Arctic is susceptible to degradation from climate change because of the massive ice that has formed just below the active layer. High-resolution satellite images of Alaska and Russia reveal that ice-wedge degradation is more extensive in the Arctic than in the subarctic because of this near-surface ice. The dynamics of ice-wedge degradation has been shown to be affected by the positive feedback of impounded surface water and negative feedbacks from rapid vegetation and peat accumulation that are able to stabilize degrading ice wedges, yet there has been no quantification of the physical mechanisms controlling the processes. This degradation of ice wedges greatly affects arctic ecosystems by altering surface topography, modifying drainage networks, enhancing peat accumulation and methane production under anaerobic conditions, and radically shifting vegetation composition, but these consequences are poorly understood. Given that ice-wedge degradation directly or indirectly affects most arctic terrain it is critical to quantify the dynamics and consequences of ice-wedge degradation.

This project addresses these uncertainties through a comprehensive assessment of the nature and extent of ice-wedge degradation, the feedbacks controlling ice-wedge dynamics, and the consequences of degradation on ecosystem patterns and processes. The research brings together an interdisciplinary team with expertise in permafrost and soil, biogeochemisty and trace gas emissions, vegetation, and remote sensing to address hypotheses through field surveys, remote sensing, and modeling. The extent and rate of ice-wedge degradation across landscapes and climates will be assessed by comparing the ice-wedge volume by terrain units, describing stages of degradation and stabilization; quantifying degradation across the circumarctic; developing image processing algorithms for mapping thermokarst; and quantifying degradation rates through aerial photo analysis. How the dynamics of ice- wedge degradation and stabilization are controlled by positive and negative feedbacks will be assessed by identifying structural properties of surface soils that protect ice wedges; quantifying differences in net radiation and soil heat flux among degradation stages; and identifying thresholds for thermokarst through numerical modeling. The consequences of ice-wedge degradation will be documented by quantifying micro-topographic changes caused by ice-wedge degradation; changes in surface water storage and drainage patterns; soil-organic carbon stocks through degradation sequence; differences in methane emissions among degradation stages; and quantifying shifts in vegetation composition through degradation sequence. 

The research is essential for understanding of the effects of climate changes on permafrost and arctic ecosystems because ice wedges are especially sensitive component of terrestrial arctic ecosystems. Knowledge of the nature and extent of ice wedges will improve land management, impact assessment, and facility design in ice-rich permafrost terrain. Information on the dynamics and feedbacks involved in ice-wedge degradation is needed to minimize effects of disturbance and to improve global climate change models that currently lack critical feedbacks. Documentation of the consequences of degradation is needed to better assess the role of fragmenting drainage networks in assessments of circumarctic hydrology, help resolve whether arctic soils will gain or lose carbon in the future, contribute information for assessing methane emissions across dynamically changing ecosystems, and provide data on the rates of vegetation change which can affect satellite measurement of vegetation productivity during assessments of vegetation greening in the Arctic."

These data are analyzed and made available to the research community by the United States IABP. IABP data were fundamental in demonstrating that atmospheric pressure has decreased, air temperature has increased, and the clockwise circulation of current and ice in the Arctic Ocean has weakened in recent decades. The integrated effect of all these changes contributed to the precipitous decrease in the average age (thickness) of sea ice observed during this period. The data help us understand the recent record low summer sea ice extents. The project will continue the United States interagency Arctic buoy program which began collecting data in 1979 and provide critical atmospheric, ice, and surface ocean measurements that cannot be obtained by other means. The project also has a multifaceted outreach program to share science with the public that includes the principal investigator participating in programs such as the Polar Science Weekend, public presentations, K-12 school visits, and public communication through interactions with journalists.  

The observations from the IABP have been essential for: 1) monitoring Arctic and global climate change, 2) forecasting weather and sea ice conditions, 3) forcing, assimilation, and validation of global weather and climate models and, 4) validation of satellite derived estimates of sea ice motion, surface temperature, sea ice thickness, etc. Our ability to predict weather and sea ice conditions requires in situ observations of surface meteorology and ice motion. These observations are assimilated into Numerical Weather Prediction models that are used to forecast weather on synoptic time scales, e.g. by the National Weather Service; and into the many long-term atmospheric re-analyses (e.g. National Centers for Environmental Prediction/National Center for Atmospheric Research re-analysis) that are used for innumerable climate studies. Based on a recommendation by the National Academy of Sciences in 1974, the Arctic Ocean Buoy Program was established by the Pacific Science Center/Applied Physics laboratory, University of Washington, in 1978 to support the Global Weather Experiment. The program continued through 1990 under funding from various agencies. In 1991, the IABP succeeded the Arctic Ocean Buoy Program, but the basic objective remains unchanged: maintaining a network of drifting buoys on the Arctic Ocean to provide meteorological and oceanographic data for real-time operational requirements and research purposes including support to the World Climate Research Program, the World Weather Watch Program, and the Arctic Observing Network. The project will collect data from all Arctic buoys, analyze, disseminate, and archive all IABP data, and maintain historical data bases."

1) Low-cloud persistence mechanisms that lead to long-lived Arctic stratiform clouds, which interact strongly with the atmospheric structure and surface energy budget;

3) Precipitation partitioning, in order to understand the different modes of precipitation at Summit and how these impact the total surface accumulation.

To address these topics, this project will utilize detailed observations from a suite of ground-based remote sensors deployed at Summit as part of the NSF/AON-funded ICECAPS project in combination with data from satellite-borne active remote sensors. High-resolution numerical modeling will also be used to investigate many of the fine-scale cloud processes and their mesoscale influences.

Non-technical abstract (E. Post, PI)
This project comprises a four-year, passive warming experiment of low-Arctic tundra vegetation at a long-term study site in Greenland, with the primary aim of measuring the response of plant roots to warming, and the role of this response in ecosystem carbon exchange.  Phenology, the annual timing and progression of events such as aboveground plant growth, is a well-studied an important component of the ecology of climate change, but remains under-studied belowground.  This study will estimate and compare above- and belowground responses of plant phenology to warming and their respective contributions to ecosystem function, specifically the exchange of carbon between the atmosphere and tundra.  It will furthermore determine which plant types, e.g., shrubs or grasses, show the greater belowground response to warming and contribution to ecosystem carbon exchange.  
Novel insights into the expected response of the Arctic to climate change will emerge from this experiment, which will also expand the infrastructure for field-based experimental and observational research in the Arctic.  This research will promote the involvement of under-represented groups by recruitment of students through Penn State?s Minority Undergraduate Research Experience program, and promote education and dissemination of its results through a summer field ecology module at the study site and in courses at Penn State and the University of Alaska-Anchorage.  Results will also be published in peer-reviewed journals and presented at international conferences by participating students and the Principal Investigators."

These changes foreshadow more dramatic impacts that will occur if the warming trend continues. Among the major challenges in anticipating these impacts are ?surprises? in system components that have remained relatively stable in the observational record (typically past few decades in arctic regions). Tundra burning is potentially one such component. Available evidence suggests that ongoing climate and vegetation change could significantly increase tundra burning. For example, preliminary findings reveal temperature and moisture thresholds, which may be crossed to result in burning rates that far exceed those witnessed in the observational record. In addition, a marked increase in shrub abundance is changing the physiognomic structure of arctic regions such that future tundra fire regimes may differ vastly from modern. Thus tundra burning is emerging as a key process in the rapidly changing Arctic, and knowledge of tundra fire-regime responses to climate change is essential for projecting Earth system dynamics, developing ecosystem management strategies, and preparing arctic residents for future change.

The short duration of observational fire records, paucity of fire-history studies, and possibility of novel future climate and vegetation greatly hinder our ability to evaluate how tundra fire regimes may respond to future climate and vegetation change. Paleoecological analysis and ecological modeling circumvent these limitations and offer the only ways to acquire such information. This research takes advantage of the complementary properties of paleoecological and modeling approaches to (1) quantify historic climate-vegetation-fire relationships in the tundra ecosystems of the North American Arctic, (2) conduct multi-proxy analyses of lake sediments to reconstruct tundra fire regimes during periods of the late Glacial and Holocene with novel combinations of climate and vegetation, (3) reparameterize ALFRESCO, a landscape ecosystem model initially developed to study the response of subarctic vegetation to changes in climate and fire regimes, for predicting tundra fire regimes under the suite of IPCC climate scenarios for the 21st century, (4) modify ED, a state-of-the-art physiologically-based model for tundra ecosystem studies, and (5) couple ED with ALFRESCO to simulate carbon dynamics related to 21st-century shifts in tundra fire regimes. Each of these elements is at the forefront of ongoing research in the respective areas, and together they promise to substantially advance our knowledge of climate-vegetation-fire interactions of tundra ecosystems for the past, present, and future.

The consequences of altered fire regimes in tundra ecosystems are rarely considered by the scientific community, largely because tundra fires occur infrequently on the modern landscape. Fire managers in the Arctic lack the most fundamental knowledge about the fire regimes of tundra ecosystems (e.g., fire return intervals) for the design and implementation of landscape-level fire and fuels management plans. This research addresses this issue directly. The prognostic simulations of the 21st century fire regime will provide information directly relevant to fire management planning and policy in Alaska. The researchers will collaborate with scientists from federal management agencies through this project. This partnership promotes an improved understanding of the range of past, present, and future climate-fire relationships by federal and state natural resource managers."

"doi:10.18739/A2X34MR3V",1203492,"Intellectual Merit: The Principal Investigators will reconstruct the Late Quaternary-Holocene behavior of Jakobshavns Isbrae (JAKIB) in western Greenland, one of the largest ice streams draining the modern Greenland Ice Sheet (GIS). The period from the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) to the present will be studied because it involves the most recent large scale change in the mass-balance of the ice sheet, it is the period that will be best preserved in continental shelf sediments, and it is the period for which the highest resolution proxy records of paleo-climate from the Greenland ice cores are available. Given the scale of this ice stream and the size of its associated drainage basin, the investigation will provide information on the Late-Quaternary-Holocene behavior and stability of a major area of the GIS. This research will allow assessment of the links between deglaciation and internal and external environmental controls, such as the influence of inflowing Atlantic Water, and will facilitate modeling of the likely future behavior of the GIS. The Principal Investigators will participate in a research cruise of the British Research Vessel, Sir James Clark Ross, to West Greenland in the late summer of 2007 and collaborate with British colleagues on the post-cruise, interdisciplinary program of laboratory work and modeling. Well-dated, high-resolution sediment records from a transect of sites extending from the shelf edge and along the shelf trough, to sites within Disko Bugt both proximal and distal to the modern ice margin will be acquired on the basis of geophysical data. The hypotheses to test using these cores are: Hypothesis 1: Glacier ice extent and interactions between the West Greenland Current and the GIS are recorded in the foraminiferal faunas, mineralogical variations, and Sm and Nd isotopic compositions of the sediments. Hypothesis 2: The West Greenland Current has changed in strength, flowpath and watermass composition from the LGM through the Holocene. These variations have played and continue to play a key role in ice-sheet behavior. Broader Impacts: The underlying rationale for this research is to determine if recent (last ~ 100 yr) observed changes to the mass balance of the GIS reflect natural variability in ice sheet dynamics, or if they relate to anthropogenically-induced climate warming. Key to resolving this is an understanding of ice sheet behavior since the LGM and including periods in the past near Greenland that were as warm or, even warmer than today, such as the middle Holocene optimum. This research will make new discoveries concerning the timing and extent of the Greenland Ice Sheet at the LGM on its western margin, and the behavior of the JAKIB ice stream during deglaciation, new information that will inform paleoceanographers and climate and sea-level modelers.

study the past history, dynamics, and ice-sheet ocean interactions in Baffin Bay, and the role of ocean warming in ice sheet demise, via multi-proxy analysis of existing (2008 and 2009) sediment cores from the West Greenland continental slope. Data from this proposal will be used to model freshwater flux from the ice streams, and will provide new information on what role the Greenland Ice Sheet played in past sea-level rise as the LGM ice sheet began to shed as much as 4.6 m of sea level equivalent.  The research will test three hypotheses using foraminiferal faunas, sediment mineralogy, stable isotope analyses, stratigraphy of iceberg rafted detritus (IRD), and visible diffuse spectral reflectance data:
1. The western margin of the GIS advanced during stadials and retreated during interstadials in
response to the presence or absence of ocean warming via the West Greenland Current.
2. Peaks of ice-berg rafted material (IRD) result from two distinct processes: Proximal IRD is
derived from retreat of the GIS off the shelf edge, whereas distal IRD results from collapse of the
Laurentide Ice Sheet and Innutian Ice Sheet/NW Greenland margins in northern Baffin Bay.
3. Advection of warm water along the West Greenland margin causes enhanced melting of
northern Baffin Bay icebergs and sea ice at the polar front, forming an IRD belt along the W.
Greenland margin, which preserves a record of ice sheet-discharge events under conditions of
ocean warming.

 The GIS is losing mass in response to modern warming. It stores enough fresh water to raise global sea level by 6.5 m, making its sensitivity to warming a major societal concern. It is anticipated that the sensitivity and response of the GIS to past warming, which are the foci of this project, will help constrain projections of the future evolution of the GIS."

To date, we have analyzed over 300 samples for chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM), chlorophyll-a (and phaeophytin), as well as a suite of cations and anions: Iron, chlorine, sulfate, nitrate, phosphate, sodium, ammonium, potassium, magnesium, and calcium (F, Cl, SO 4 , NO 3 , PO4, Na, NH 4 , K, Mg, and Ca). Biogeochemical data reveal distinct spatial and seasonal variability in chlorophyll biomass, CDOM, and major cations/anions. In general, waters sampled in April had consistently distinctly higher concentrations of inorganic solutes. Lake waters with the highest total dissolved solid concentrations (~3000 mg/L) were dominated by Na and Cl, indicating a potential seawater influence. The remaining samples grade towards Ca-Mg-HCO 3 -type waters, reflecting dissolution of carbonate minerals found in underlying rocks and sandstone cements. We also found that chlorophyll concentrations and CDOM absorption were both generally higher during April (compared with August), suggesting significant biological/biogeochemical activity even under lake ice during this early part of the year. By August, primary production may have been limited by the presence of sufficient nutrients and CDOM concentrations may have therefore declined owing to photodegradation processes or bacterial decomposition. One additional striking observation is the latitudinal trend in some biogeochemical constituents, generally increasing from south to north.","Beck, R. A., K. M. Hinkel, W. R. Eisner, D. Whiteman, C.

Since 2007, the ITEX-Arctic Observatory Network (ITEX-AON) has continued and expanded on the ITEX program across a latitudinal transect of five sites in Alaska and Greenland, collecting core ITEX data specifically designed to address the current needs outlined in the Study of Environmental Arctic Change (SEARCH) Implementation Report.  The goal of this effort is to maintain the continuity of the temporally-critical datasets of the ITEX-AON in Alaska and Greenland.  Core datasets include the long-term manual observations of phenology, vegetation structure and composition, ecosystem function, and surface properties on the long-term ITEX control and experimental warming plots, repeat measurement of the vegetation plots on the 1km2 ARCSS grids, and a multifactor warming-moisture experiment in Greenland.  The simultaneous measurement of multiple surface properties at the small scale has allowed detection of relationships not previously recognized, e.g., in moss-dominated areas of the intensive transects, higher albedo is linked to higher temperatures.  Continuation of these measurements is imperative because increasing evidence points towards the critical importance of carry-over effects of the previous growing seasons on current and future responses and the inherent variability in the system precluded determination of the system response on the basis of a few years.

Many of these water bodies traditionally freeze solid during the winter, preserving sub-lake permafrost and keeping soil carbon stocks immobile at depth.  Slightly deeper lakes maintain some liquid water beneath floating ice, causing deep thaw zones in otherwise continuous permafrost.  Evidence suggests that thinner ice growth in response to warmer, snowier winters is pushing many bedfast ice lakes to floating ice regimes.  If such a regime shift becomes pervasive across lake-rich landscapes, resulting permafrost thaw and enhanced moisture and heat flux could generate positive feedbacks, further amplifying this regime change. 

This project examines the extent and dynamics of bedfast and floating ice lakes in relation to hypothesized interactions and feedback with permafrost and climate.  A combination of remote sensing, field monitoring and geophysical measurements, experiments and physical models are used to isolate processes, quantify interactions and project changes.  Project findings will be relevant locally for native village subsistence and for water supply to the petroleum industry, and globally for scientists studying permafrost thaw and Arctic climate change."

The power of the International Tundra Experiment (ITEX)- Arctic Observatory Network (AON) is founded on a capacity to synthesize and compare results across sites that use standardized sampling protocols. Specifically, this project will (1) maintain the data-streams at ITEX-AON sites in Alaska near Toolik Lake, Imnavait Creek, Utqiagvik (Barrow), and Atqasuk; (2) lead two new ITEX network syntheses focused on soil carbon and phenocam imagery; (3) increase scientific literacy; and, (4) expand citizen science opportunities across communities in northern Alaska. The project will sustain an array of large and publicly available data-streams documenting ecosystem change occurring across the Arctic and will team up with citizen scientists to expand the monitoring footprint of the network and the societal relevance of this work to communities across the North Slope of Alaska. 

The ITEX network was chartered in 1990 to document and understand the ecological impacts of a warming Arctic. The US-led ITEX projects expanded their monitoring efforts across a larger spatial area with the use of automated sampling to form an Arctic Observatory Network (AON) in 2009. The ITEX-AON currently includes traditional ITEX measurements (phenology, cover, carbon flux and nutrient cycling), as well as phenocams, automated mobile sensor platforms (MISP) and mid-scale aerial imagery of 1 km2 ARCSS (Arctic System Science) grids established in the 1990s. In this phase of the project, collection of core data sets will be sustained and new data sets will be added with the aim of identifying and understanding patterns of change and feedbacks. Specifically, ITEX-AON will expand its collection of vegetation functional traits to better understand ecosystem response and predict future change. ITEX-AON will also further expand automated measurements to link plot level change (sampled by hand or with hand-held equipment) with landscape level observations (sampled by phenocams or drones) and high resolution regional imagery (sampled by aircraft or satellite). The new phase of ITEX-AON will include two synthesis efforts: (1) an examination of soil carbon dynamics across the ITEX network, and (2) a multi-scale phenological analysis using phenocam and high resolution satellite imagery to determine fine-scale spatiotemporal patterns of seasonal greening trends across the Arctic. Mentoring of postdocs, and training of graduate and undergraduate students are some of the primary broader impacts of this project. The project will continue to provide a test bed for engineering and software development that will be shared freely among the ITEX network and broader science community and will expand outreach activities aimed at improving science literacy.

However, this habitat is also among the most sensitive to disturbances such as heavy metal pollution, eutrophication, and drainage or desiccation from climate warming. Environmental indicator species in freshwater have both acted as sentinels for ongoing change and as proxies for historical change. Phantom midges (Chaoborus), for example, are among the most important freshwater dipterans for aquatic toxicology and for indicating a boreal zone climate. In some cases, Chaoborus is believed to be a better sentinel of boreal forest-tundra boundary changes than the tree line because trees can have a growth lag that is negligible in midges. The larvae of Chaoborus are also voracious predators of microcrustaceans and, as such, can strongly affect the species compositions of freshwater habitats. The PI has recently found that two species of Chaoborus are common well beyond the tree line in roadside ponds of the Seward Peninsula of northwestern Alaska. This finding provides an opportunity to improve understanding of how tundra lakes and ponds may change as they encounter a keystone predator of the boreal zone. Moreover, the effect of direct human disturbances such as road construction on the freshwaters of the boreal zone ? tundra boundary can be assessed.

Several aspects of the biology of Chaoborus in subarctic North America are poorly known. Because there are slight morphological differences between tundra species and well-studied temperate species, the geographic source and even the species name of the tundra populations are unclear. One objective of this research is to test hypotheses about the genetic affinities of Chaoborus that are presently found on the tundra. This involves phylogenetic comparisons of tundra specimens with those from eastern Asia, and with boreal Alaska. Another goal is to test the hypothesis that road construction has facilitated the expansion of boreal zone Chaoborus deep into the tundra. Testing this hypothesis involves testing for the erosion of genetic diversity on tundra ponds compared to forest ponds with high-resolution genetic markers. This project will also carry out paleoecological assessments of the rate and mode of colonization of tundra ponds. This research will inform environmental biologists, fisheries managers, engineers and planners about the role of human disturbance on the freshwater ecosystems across the tundra-boreal forest boundary at a critical time. The project will enhance or even enable comparative studies of environment-indicating chaoborids and promote a deeper understanding of recent and ongoing anthropogenic change in subarctic freshwaters. The speed and mode of colonization of tundra ponds by Chaoborus midges is important to paleoecology but unknown."

The study will include ground-based studies, an examination of infrastructure and landscape change at multiple scales, and a human dimension component that includes evaluation of adaptive management planning for infrastructure in northern Alaska and CE studies associated with the Iñupiat village of Nuiqsut. The study will develop a process-based understanding of infrastructure-related permafrost/ landform/ vegetation succession in terrain undergoing thermokarst formation (the development of highly eroded landforms the result from the thawing of ice-rich permafrost).

will consist of local people who interact with development infrastructure, permafrost scientists, ecologists, hydrologists, engineers, social scientists and educators seeking to develop adaptive management strategies that address the unique issues related to networks of infrastructure in arctic permafrost
environments. Three workshops will bring panarctic participants together, first in a scoping workshop and then to focus specifically on the two most rapidly expanding areas of Arctic infrastructure, the North Slope of Alaska and the Yamal Peninsula, Russia. 3) An education/outreach component  will train students in arctic systems and introduce them to the issues of industrial development and adaptive management approaches during an expedition along the Elliott and Dalton highways in Alaska. The course will include a section at Prudhoe Bay to learn firsthand about the issues with oilfield infrastructure, its impacts and vegetation rehabilitation practices.
